# 🏀 Basketball Points Counter  

A very simple Flutter app that acts as a **basketball points counter**.  
It was created mainly for **learning purposes**:  
- To practice how **buttons** work in Flutter.  
- To understand the difference between **StatefulWidget** and **StatelessWidget**.  

## ✨ Features  
- Add points to **Team A** or **Team B** (1, 2, or 3 points).  
- Reset both teams’ points to zero.  
- Simple UI with an AppBar and buttons.  

## 📚 What I learned  
- How to use `StatefulWidget` to update the UI dynamically with `setState()`.  
- Why `StatelessWidget` doesn’t work when values need to change.  
- Basics of button handling (`ElevatedButton`).
